What is it?
-----------

A personal financial management and goal tracking tool.


How does it work?
-----------------

Using information you provide about your existing financial accounts, coinbox displays various
metrics to help you track changes in your own "net worth" over time, and makes it easier to
visualize trends that can help you make better-informed financial decisions.

Coinbox supports four basic types of accounts:

* General (e.g.: checking, savings)
* Investment (e.g.: securities, retirement)
* Assets (e.g.: things other than money that have intrinsic value )
* Liabilities (e.g.: credit cards, loans, debts)

At the end of each day, coinbox tallies up the changes to each of your accounts and presents
the following metrics:

* End of day balance in each account
* Combined net worth today
* Change in combined net worth from (1 day ago, 1 week ago, 1 month ago, start of calendar year, 1 year ago)
